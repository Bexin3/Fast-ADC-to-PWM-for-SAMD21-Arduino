# Fast-ADC-to-PWM-for-SAMD21-Arduino
A .ino project for SAMD21 Arduinos tested on Arduino Zero that allows conversion of Analog values into PWM duty cycle, tested frequencies are 0.035-200000hz
Newest version support m0 seeduino xiao and custom choosing of analog input and PWM output pins, as well as higher frequency range.
